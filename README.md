# Homework

If you can't figure out how to solve a problem, ask on Slack. 

Move onto the next one, while you wait for help...


## Problem 1
Ask the user for 5 numbers and show the sum at the end

## Problem 2
Ask the user for a word, then display if the length of the work is even or odd

## Problem 3
Ask the user for 5 numbers
After they have entered the numbers, show the smallest and largest numbers entered

## Problem 4
Ask the user for 3 words   
After they have entered the words, show the shortest word

## Problem 5
Ask the user to enter a number   
Display that amount of stars e.g.

```
Enter a number: 3   
***
```

## Problem 6
Tell the user to enter a specific work and then tell the user if they entered it correctly or not.
The word can be the same, each time 

E.g.
```
Enter 'Mississippi': Misisippi   
You entered the word incorrectly   
```

Once this is working make it ignore case e.g.   
```
Enter 'Mississippi': mississippi   
You entered the word correctly   
```

## Problem 7
Make the computer generate a random number from 0 to 9   
Then show that amount of stars e.g.

```
Random number chosen by the computer was: 7
*******
```

## Problem 8
Ask the user to choose a number 0,1 or 2.   
Make the computer choose a random number or 0,1 or 2.

Tell the user if they guessed correctly

## Problem 9
Ask the user for 2 words, then display the words, ordered by length   
E.g. display the shortest one then the longest one

Once this is working, ask for 3 words and display these ordered by length 


## Problem 10
Ask the user for 5 numbers
After they have entered the numbers, show the average of the numbers

Once this is working, start by asking how many numbers the user would like to enter, then stat asking for numbers.
